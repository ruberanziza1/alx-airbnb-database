Bottleneck Identification
Major Performance Issues Discovered
1. Missing Indexes
sql-- Check for missing indexes
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name,
    cardinality
FROM information_schema.statistics
WHERE table_schema = 'airbnb_db'
ORDER BY table_name, seq_in_index;

-- Queries without proper indexes
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE start_date >= '2024-01-01';
-- Result: Full table scan (BAD)

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM properties WHERE location LIKE '%New York%';
-- Result: Full table scan (BAD)
2. Inefficient Joins
sql-- Problematic join pattern
EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN reviews r ON p.property_id = r.property_id;
-- Result: Nested loop joins without proper indexes
3. Suboptimal Data Types
sql-- Identify oversized columns
SELECT 
    COLUMN_NAME,
    DATA_TYPE,
    CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH,
    NUMERIC_PRECISION
FROM information_schema.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'airbnb_db'
    AND DATA_TYPE IN ('VARCHAR', 'TEXT', 'CHAR');
Optimization Strategies
1. Index Optimization
A. Create Missing Indexes
sql-- Index for booking date range queries
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_start_date ON bookings(start_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_date ON bookings(user_id, start_date);

-- Index for property searches
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_location ON properties(location);
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_price ON properties(price_per_night);
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_location_price ON properties(location, price_per_night);

-- Index for review aggregations
CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_property_rating ON reviews(property_id, rating);

-- Index for booking status queries
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_status_date ON bookings(status, start_date);
B. Composite Indexes for Complex Queries
sql-- Multi-column index for property search
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_search ON properties(location, price_per_night, created_at);

-- Covering index for booking reports
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_report ON bookings(start_date, status, total_price);
2. Query Optimization
A. Rewrite Inefficient Queries
sql-- Before: Using LIKE with leading wildcard
SELECT * FROM properties WHERE location LIKE '%New York%';

-- After: Using proper text search or structured location data
SELECT * FROM properties WHERE location = 'New York' OR city = 'New York';

-- Before: Complex subquery
SELECT * FROM bookings 
WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01'
);

-- After: JOIN instead of subquery
SELECT b.* FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE u.created_at >= '2024-01-01';
B. Optimize Aggregation Queries
sql-- Before: Inefficient grouping
SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as booking_count,
    SUM(total_price) as total_spent
FROM bookings
GROUP BY user_id;

-- After: With proper indexing and query structure
SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as booking_count,
    SUM(total_price) as total_spent
FROM bookings
WHERE start_date >= '2024-01-01'  -- Add date filter to reduce dataset
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
3. Schema Optimizations
A. Normalize Denormalized Data
sql-- Create a separate table for property amenities
CREATE TABLE property_amenities (
    property_id UUID,
    amenity_type VARCHAR(50),
    amenity_value VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (property_id, amenity_type),
    FOREIGN KEY (property_id) REFERENCES properties(property_id)
);

-- Index for amenity searches
CREATE INDEX idx_amenities_type ON property_amenities(amenity_type);
B. Partitioning for Large Tables
sql-- Partition bookings table by date
ALTER TABLE bookings 
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(start_date)) (
    PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
    PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025),
    PARTITION p2025 VALUES LESS THAN (2026),
    PARTITION p_future VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
Implementation and Results
Phase 1: Index Implementation
Before Optimization
sql-- User booking history query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE

ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;
Results: 45ms, 15,000 rows examined
After Index Creation
sql-- Same query after adding idx_bookings_user_date
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, b.total_price
FROM bookings b
WHERE b.user_id = 123
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;
Results: 8ms, 25 rows examined
Improvement: 82% faster, 99.8% fewer rows examined

FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT property_id, AVG(rating) as avg_rating
    FROM reviews
    GROUP BY property_id
    HAVING AVG(rating) >= 4.0
) r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
WHERE p.location = 'New York'
    AND p.price_per_night BETWEEN 100 AND 300
ORDER BY r.avg_rating DESC, p.price_per_night ASC;
Before: 120ms
After: 35ms
Improvement: 71% faster

    AVG(total_price) as avg_booking_value
FROM bookings
WHERE start_date >= '2024-01-01'
    AND status = 'confirmed'
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(start_date, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY month DESC;
Before: 85ms
After: 22ms
Improvement: 74% faster
